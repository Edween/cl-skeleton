* Tests

The =${PROJECT_NAME}= tests are provided as part of the
=:${PROJECT_NAME}.test= system.

In order to run the tests you can evaluate the following expressions.

#+begin_src lisp
CL-USER> (ql:quickload :${PROJECT_NAME}.test)
CL-USER> (asdf:test-system :${PROJECT_NAME}.test)
#+end_src

Or you can run the tests using the =scripts/run-tests.sh= shell script
instead, e.g.

#+begin_src shell
env LISP=sbcl ./scripts/run-tests.sh
#+end_src

Here's how to run the tests against SBCL, CCL and ECL for example.

#+begin_src shell
for lisp in sbcl ccl ecl; do
    echo "Running tests using ${lisp} ..."
    env LISP=${lisp} make test > ${lisp}-tests.out
done
#+end_src
